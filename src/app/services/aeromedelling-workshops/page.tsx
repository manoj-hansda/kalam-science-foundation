      <p className="mt-10">
        Aeromodelling workshop can be an exciting and educational experience for
        participants interested in aviation, engineering, and design. Aero
        modelling is one of the finest hobbies, which is very popular worldwide
        among people of all ages and professions. It has often been the starting
        point of many Pilots and Aeronautical engineers. &quot;It is a hobby in which
        a cadet learns to build up the model of actual aircrafts which are
        unable to carry persons and used for sports purposes”.

      <h2 className="text-lg mt-6">WHEN AEROMODELLING STARTED</h2>

      <p className="mt-6">
        The history of Aeromodelling goes back much further than the history of
        real aircraft. It was started in the nineteenth century by Dr. Thomas
        Young who discovered the lifting property of a cambered surfaces
        comparison to flat surface.
      </p>
      <ul className="mt-6">
        <li>• Sir George Caley built a helicopter model
        in 1796.</li>
        <li>• John Stringfellow built a spring-operated model in 1842.</li>
        <li>• Alphonse Penand invented model fitted with tail surfaces and wings with
        dihedral angle.</li>
        <li>• In 1918, Professor Langley built a petrol driven model
        called Aerodrome No. 5. This revolutionized the concept of Aeromodelling
        as there was now an ideal power plant small enough are used in aero
        models.</li>
      </ul>
