      <h1 className="text-xl font-medium text-teal">Career Guidance</h1>
      <p className="mt-10">
        In India, career guidance often comes from our parents, friends and
        teachers. While they might offer sound advice, it is usually a
        reflection of their own interests, experiences and preferences. It may
        not always align with a candidate&apos;s personal goals, ambitions and
        personalities. In case one takes inappropriate decisions because of
        wrong advice, years down the line, the individual might end up
        regretting their career choice. Career guidance is a process that
        assists individuals in identifying their career goals and pursuing the
        right path to achieve them. We KALAM Science Foundation-INDIA, provide a
        career guidance. In this process of self-discovery, a career advisor
        introduces each student to various tools like SWOT and psychometric
        assessments to make it easier for them to comprehend their areas of
        interest and skills. It is through these tests that the advisor
        determines the most suitable career options for an individual.
