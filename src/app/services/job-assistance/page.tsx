          Job Assistance Whether studying or learning courses like Engineering,
          Diploma, Marketing, etc., every student dreams of cracking a job. They
          plan their career in such a way that they achieve their dream job
          after they get out of the institute. Every student pursuing their
          dream course works hard to reach their dream position. For this, they
          need to plan their career to grab all the opportunities from the
          institutes in which they are learning the course. Here is where the
          placement features of our KALAM Science Foundation-INDIA come into the
          picture. It is one of the essential factors that help the student
          decide to join any institute. As serious aspirants, we need to check
          if the institute has the feature of placements because not every
          facility provides this. For example, some institutes offer job or
          placement assistance while others give a 100% job guarantee.
          Therefore, before choosing any training institute, students should
          understand the differences between these two facilities. The placement
          assistance doesn&apos;t get you a job surety. It&apos;s all about
          providing you with the necessary guidance. This facility doesn&apos;t
          confirm whether you will get the job or not. In your training
          institutions, the placement assistance you get only includes sending
          you to the employer for an interview. Whether you&apos;ll get a job
          depends on you in this placement assistance. This is because placement
          assistance service providers don&apos;t give any guarantee. They
          don&apos;t even help you in the official process. The maximum
          they&apos;ll do is send you for another interview. If you fail the
          interview, also, they don&apos;t provide any written commitment to
          your placement.
