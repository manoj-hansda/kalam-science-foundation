        Our work just started! In fact, we have not even scratched the surface,
        let alone, but we are already touching lives positively beyond
        imaginations. The KSF’s first role is to educate the general public
        through extensive education, awareness and enlightenment campaign for
        better understanding of our future requirements. The business of
        insurance will change, either because we, as an industry, have
        proactively defined our future, or because it has been shaped and
        defined for us by the external influencers that are at work all around
        us.

        The potential for our industry is enormous. This is the time to build
        new strategies, embrace innovation, transformation initiatives, and
        create new ideas that can succeed in a new digital future. Poor income
        source, lack of awareness about education, absence of educational
        institutions in rural areas were some drawbacks hindering the progress
        of education in India, We are the KSF-INDIA and we are doing everything
        we can to improve the lives of our upcoming generation and to develop
        the means to find a cure for more healthy tomorrows with creating ideas
        and initiatives to transform INDIA into a developed nation.
